# AdventOfCode

Goals:

* Do each part in at least 2 different languages

* Try to keep code idiomatic to each language

* Even though it's not required, add in error checking when not inconvenient, just for good practice.

* Even though I've done some of them in the past, I want to redo them again

* Hopefully this will cure those boring, lonely nights, at least for a while
